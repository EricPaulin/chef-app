### RoboChef
RoboChef is a recipe site that helps users decide what to cook. Users simply need to add ingreidents to the list and once at least 4 ingredieints have been added, RoboChef can generate a relavent recipe and even gives a detailed breakdown on the quanitiy of ingredients needed for the recipe as well as the steps in preparing the recipe itself. RoboChef was made using React, Vite, and the Hugging Face Recipe API.

### Features
- Recipe Generation
- Responsive Design + Error Handling
- Custom Sprites + Animation

### Challenges and Solutions
This project was to practice React fundamentals,APIs, and error handling. Understanding how React is component based and its unidirectional data flow was crucial to get information across the site. A lot of trial and error occured in this proejct but I belive it helped me understand React better and realize how powerful components could be. I also aimed to form good coding habits by using correct naming conventions like capital Pages and lower case components as well as organizing code and commenting everything well. I also did a little bit of UX by making it so the ingredient array didn't accidentally add the same ingredient multiple times or add blank/empty ingredients to the list which would only serve to irritate the user. Error handling was the last thing I did and tok the longest as I made a custom error message component so the user could see the error that arose in each error case.
